> **Melodia is a mulitplayer game written in Java, inspired by games like Zelda and Secret of Mana.**

This project is what has become of a little experiment gone out of hand. While learning my first steps in Java, I was wondering how a game would work. A while later I had a static image moving on top of another image by pressing the arrow keys.

*Fast forward a few years and this is the result;*

Melodia has become a multiplayer game, making the player able to walk across different maps (of which two are realised in the proof of concept). Players are able to kill monsters, die themselves only to be respawned anew. Change the colours of their tunics to any given colour and chat with each other.

This all wrapped up in a little proof of concept game called Melodia, with background music taken from Ragnarok Online and maps, sprites taken from Zelda: blabla and Secret of Mana.

Being a programmer first, I took these sprites from Shyguy Kingdom to realise a simple game that looked good as well. These images and other resources used belong to their respective owners. The source code written in Java and XML is licensed under the MIT License, which means you are free to fork and build upon this game. I have abandonded it, so feel free but give credit where due. It has gained some sentimental value in my early years of learning how to code ;-)

The sprites on this site are the works of countless others whose names would be too many to mention and, in the case of the sprites from games, are often unknown.

This is not due to any attempted ownership of artwork that are not the property of The Shyguy Kingdom, but rather of the data other than the artwork in the sheets.
